By giving you this method, we can ensure that everyone should get the exact same result, as well as that the results will match with the Decision Tree implementation of scikit-learn. For example, `create_split()` puts all samples `<=` then the threshold into the left child node (and all others into the right child node). However, there would be no principle difference to put them in the right child node (and all others into the left child node). It's purely a convention to ensure consistency.
