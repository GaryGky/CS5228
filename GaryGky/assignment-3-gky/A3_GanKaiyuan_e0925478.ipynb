    "You have now implemented a basic model-based recommender system using (non-negative) Matrix Factorization. Since we used only a toy rating matrix, performance was not an issue here. In real-world recommendations with many users and items, Matrix Factorization can be quite time consuming. The problem is that online platforms are very dynamic: users are joining and leaving, new items are added, users add new or update previous ratings. All of those cases change the rating matrix.\n",

    "**How do different cases (e.g., new user/item/rating) affect a current result of a Matrix Factorization for a recommender system?

What are good practical strategies to address the Cold-Start Problem and other changes to the rating matrix using Matrix Factorization?\n",

For this task, you can utilize any method from [`nx.algorithms.shortest_paths`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/shortest_paths.html).

    "The Girvan-Newman Algorithm finds communities in a graph by assuming a strongly connected graph and then iteratively removing a minimum set of edges until the graph breaks into 2 components. The criteria to remove an edge is based on the Edge Betweenness Centrality; cf. lecture slides. The Edge Betweenness Centrality $c_{B}(e)$ of an Edge $e$ given a Graph $G=(V,E)$ is defined as:\n",

As such, we could again utilize [`nx.algorithms.shortest_paths`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/shortest_paths.html). However, it gets a bit tedious since we here need **all** shortest paths between **all** pairs of nodes. So you can simply use [`nx.algorithms.centrality.edge_betweenness_centrality`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.edge_betweenness_centrality.html) here.\n",

Here are 2 additional constraints:\n",

    "| (1)  | `girvan_newman()` removes the edge with the largest Edge Betweenness Centrality value. For the 4 edges that get removed from the MRT Graph, why do the values increase after each iteration? | When removing the largest Edge Betweenness Centrality value, the topology of the graph changes, so that there will be a edge is contained by more shortest paths in the graph.                                                                                                 |\n",
    "| (2)  | `girvan_newman()` always removes only one edge in each iteration even if 2 or more dges have the same maximum Edge Betweenness Centrality. Why is this meaningful, or why don't we remove all edge with the same maximum Edge Centrality in the same iteration? | We don't remove all edge with same max Edge Centrality because removing one of the edge causes change to the graph so that it might not be the case that the previous max-value edge still has the max value after change.                                                     |\n",
